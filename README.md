# ai-api
REST API built with Node / Express

# Getting Started
Before you can run this project, you must have a valid API key from Open AI.


# Install
```sh
npm install express axios
```

# Run
```sh
node app.js
```

Remember to replace 'Bearer YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY' with your actual API key.

Your API is now running and you can make POST requests to http://localhost:3000/chat.
